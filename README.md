About This Project
This interactive project uses PoseNet (via ml5.js) to estimate your body posture in real time from your webcam feed. Built with p5.js, it offers several fun and educational features.

🔧 How It Works
Pose Detection: Tracks keypoints like eyes, shoulders, hips, etc.
Skeleton Drawing: Connects keypoints to show a live skeleton.
Mode Selection: Switch modes to explore games, measurements, and visual tools.
🧠 Modes
Default: Shows pose, posture check, distance, height, and object measurements.
🎭 Pose Challenge: Try to match silhouette poses with a timer and score.
📏 Measurements: Arm span, torso length, and leg length estimates.
🎨 Heatmap: Confidence visualization for each body part (red-yellow-green).
😊 Cartoon Avatar: Emoji face and stick-figure body drawn from your pose.
🪁 Breathing Exercise: Calming visual guide to inhale/exhale every 4 seconds.
🧰 Tech Used
